h1. Textile Documenter

This project comes as the solution to the lack of a text-based document solution. LaTeX is not my favorite flavor, and HTML rocks since it can be printed or used on the web. Writing HTML sucks. Textile eases that out.


So you can edit the RAKEFILE so you can change the documentation folder, the output folder, the tittle and the template used.

Usage: 

@rake@

or

@rake generate_docs@

It will copy everything from the origin folder, and replace the .textile for .html using the erb template.
